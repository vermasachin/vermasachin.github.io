Just finished installing "**[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)**" on my personal site. The site that you are currently reading this post on is hosted on GitHub pages using Jekyll.

Bigrock was a pain in the A**, so transferred my domain to Namecheap now and will be doing same for my other domains on Bigrock & GoDaddy (if you didn't already know, GoDaddy, Bigrock and some other domain registrars sell your data to spammers).

I am still new to Jekyll, though I have used Github pages previously. My next few steps will be to customise the theme and create a static front page or maybe just a static section above posts on the homepage.
